## Email Marketing for NatureScapes.net

### Background
NatureScapes is one of the longest running websites for nature photographers to network and learn from each other. As a brand, NatureScapes is comprised of several different business segments of photographers in their audience.

Since 2009 I’ve designed and developed hundreds of email communications to support various stages of the customer journey. These areas include messages for online store advertisements, luxury travel, monthly newsletters, and transactional emails throughout the website.

### Emails with Consistent Results
All emails are responsive. I have designed, developed, tested, and analyzed them from the ground up. I’ve exceeded many benchmarks including consistently high open and click rates along with low bounce rates. Less than 10% of Constant Contact users accomplish this, resulting in strong customer engagement and loyalty.

To increase email list sign-ups, a special offer was implemented using an autoresponder. This change resulted in a 447% increase in email list growth over 6 months. In turn, the offer’s campaign conversion rate increased by 23% with 3x the transactions in 6 months.

## Design Process for Email Marketing

### NatureScapes Email Template Wireframes
#### Wireframes and Outline for Responsive Template
After creating an outline of the types of email messages that are sent, I determined which elements were the most common. The goal was to create a responsive template that could be used throughout different types of communications.

1. Responsive Template Wireframes & Design
When I first started at the company, there was not a cohesive email system in place therefore I had to build one from the ground up.

##### FEATURED PROBLEM: NON-EXISTENT EMAIL SYSTEM
First, I determined what types of messages were sent for all communications in order to design and develop a core responsive template that could be used and adapted throughout. The types of emails included informational, promotional, transactional, survey invitations, autoresponders, and other notifications.
I then created an outline of each type of message and listed its purpose and goals. For example, promotional store emails contain links to featured product categories and store customer service, whereas travel ads contain links to the upcoming tour schedule and reviews.
##### DESIGN APPROACH
For most messages, the logo, navigation, and footer were the three common elements required. I created wireframes for each section so the team could review and provide feedback. The core template layout was then designed and built with these three areas as the foundation.
Every email sent during the customer journey was designed to work together, from aquisition to purchase follow-up.
